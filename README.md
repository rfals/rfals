Hi there! I am currently studying my final year in finance and economics at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga. As a data scientist, I am skilled in using Python and R to analyze and interpret complex data sets. I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and continue learning in the field. On my GitHub profile, you can find some of the projects I have worked on as well as my contributions to various open source projects. I hope you find my work interesting and I welcome any feedback or collaboration opportunities. Thanks for visiting my profile!
